As stated in the [README](README.md), the objectives of the TDX module’s open-source initiative are to review its source code and to provide users with the capability to verify the exact source code that corresponds to Intel released signed TDX Module binary. To create a binary that is identical to the official release binary, it is essential to adhere to the provided [build instructions](BUILD.md). Signed binaries are available as release assets for every release and could be found [here](https://github.com/intel/tdx-module/releases).
